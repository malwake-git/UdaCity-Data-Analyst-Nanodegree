## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose. Once expansion is complete, Ford GoBike will grow to 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.

> Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.

> The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.


> The FordGoBike 2017 is a straightforward and easy to understand and work with data set. This data set has been collected efficiently, providing an amazing collection of data to draw conclusions.

> This data was collected between Jun and Dec 2017. it has around 450000 rows, which consist of bike rides in San Francisco, California, US.


## Summary of Findings

> I'll summerize my work in two questions:

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

> *This section specifically amplified the previous data topics of exploration through using different visuals and adding in more variables. Subscriber vs Customer age was expanded upon through the use of age groups, and a line plot to demonstrate the varying habits of each age group. The heatmap revealed little but not much new for the time-based discussion on when and what time each user group uses the bike sharing system. However, it was a double authentication.*


### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

> *Nothing to much out of the expected. It was interesting to note the monthly difference for males vs. females vs. other, and others. As well as, how customers use the FordGo bike system intensively throughout the weekdays and weekends, in addition, to the crowd hours during the days' hours. This may be a potential loss of possible Customers converting to Subscribers.*

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the count of bikes trips in the bike sharing system is interacting with different variables, such as, distance, user types, day hours, etc. Therefore, I start by introducing the elements that plays a big rule in bike trips, followed by the fixing some faults that might happen, then plot each individually, afterwards, I started taking more than an elements, in addition to count of trips, to make the multivariate and bivariate, which happed to be very useful supporting the exploration and predication I had at first .
